# Noon Menu Scraper

## Does your company get lunch caitered by Noon?
## Are you always wondering what delicious concoction you are eating?
## Well then this scraper is the one for you!
### All you need is a Slack App and you're good to go! 
You don't actually need a Slack App, but its very inconvenient to get a personal message everyday.

Depending on how you automate, this script will: 
- Get today's date
- Download the appropriate menu
- Collect the English text
- And output the menu in a organised layout, ready with Slack emoji's! :fire:
